# 🌅 Solarized Osaka Discord Theme


A beautiful **Solarized Osaka** theme, originally created by [@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog), now ported to Discord.  

If you’ve ever searched for a **Solarized Dark** theme for **BetterDiscord** or **Vesktop** and came up empty — I’ve been there too. That’s why I built this theme completely from scratch, staying true to the Solarized aesthetic while giving Discord a sleek Osaka-inspired twist.
